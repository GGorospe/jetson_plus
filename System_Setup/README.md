# System Setup
A collection of BASH scripts used to setup a jetbot.

Start with the most recent jetpack OS image from Nvidia, then use these scripts to add important functionality.
After running all scripts, your robot will have the same capabilities as a Sparkfun jetbot.

IMPORTANT: you must add permissions to the files first, then you must execute the files.

Directions: 
1. Flash the most recent jetpack os to a SD card for your jetbot
1. After booting the system for the first time and connecting to the internet, clone this repository
2. Navigate to System_Setup directory
3. sudo chmod+ *.sh

5.  ./jetson_nano_setup_two.sh
...
8.  ./ jetson_nano_setup_five.sh
