# System Setup
A collection of BASH scripts used to setup a jetbot.

Start with the most recent jetpack OS image from Nvidia, then use these scripts to add important functionality.
After running all scripts, your robot will have the same capabilities as a Sparkfun jetbot.

IMPORTANT: you must add permissions to the files first, then you must source the files.
